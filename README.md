Registration Form with Validation
This project is a simple and user-friendly Registration Form built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to enter their name, email, and phone number, with built-in form validation to ensure data correctness before submission.

Key Features:

.Clean and modern design with centered layout and styled input fields.

.Validation rules:

.Name: Only letters allowed, no spaces or special characters.

.Email: Must be a valid Gmail address (e.g., user@gmail.com).

.Phone Number: Exactly 10 digits.

.Real-time error messages displayed below the input fields if the user input is invalid.

.On successful validation, the form alerts the user that the submission was successful.

This form demonstrates basic but effective form validation techniques using regular expressions in JavaScript, helping improve user input quality and overall user experience.
